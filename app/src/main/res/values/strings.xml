    <string name="help_app_desc">RecycleDump is a location-based app linking waste disposers to collectors and disposal points. We refer to these as \'disposal opportunities\'. These could be anything from scrap metal collectors and clothing bins to public skips and individuals making use of recyclables. \n\nEach has a classification of categories of waste it will accept. If you\'d like to find a disposal opportunity for your waste items, simply add them to your library within the app. You\'ll then be shown the nearest points that will take your item, or be notified when such disposal opportunity becomes available. \n\nThe real power of the app is linking together producers and consumers of waste, facilitating a more efficient waste collection system for everyone.</string>

    <string name="i_just_want_to_get_rid_of_something">I just want to get rid of something, what do I do?</string>
    <string name="help_disposal_tutorial">Head to the main screen and select the green \'Dispose of something\' button. Then, choose whether you want to recycle or dump your item. \n\nFill out the details of your item, most importantly the category so we can match you to the appropriate locations. \n\nOnce you\'ve saved your item head to your items library from the side menu on the left, where your item should be displayed. By clicking on its cell, you can check the map for surrounding locations/collectors that accept your item. \n\nIt\'s no problem if there are no disposal opportunities initially, we\'ll notify you as soon as one comes up.</string>
    <string name="where_does_the_disposal_opportunity_data_come_from">Where does the disposal opportunity data come from?</string>
    <string name="help_data_contribution">Details of locations and collectors are contributed to the app in one of two ways: \n\n1. Us obtaining data directly from local councils and pulling it from location-based networks such as Neighbourly. \n\n2. Private collectors of waste/recyclables can upload their information through the app, as well as users who have found useful disposal opportunities themselves. This option enables a truly collaborative approach to recycling and waste management.</string>
    <string name="what_s_coming_next_for_recycledump">What\'s coming next for RecycleDump?</string>
    <string name="help_whats_next">Future releases will focus on collectors and locations; letting them create and manage their disposal opportunity. If you are such a user, you\'ll have access to fine-grained control of your listing.</string>
